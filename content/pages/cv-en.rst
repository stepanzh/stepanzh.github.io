Professional experience
-----------------------

Senior engineer · R&D · Huawei Russian Research Institute via Coleman Group
===========================================================================

Moscow, Russia ⋅ 2024 – now

- R&D in high-performance numerical linear algebra to meet performance and accuracy KPIs of existing solvers, find best software and provide guidelines for team members.
- Developed robust solver for a poorly-conditioned numerical optimization problem (constrained quadratic programming).
- Deployed knowledge base and managed knowledge of 15-people team across two projects to improve communication within the team, to collaborate easily with headquarters and to make scientifically correct problem statements that meet business needs, to prepare reports easier.
- Managed two colleagues to prepare and teach together an R&D-focused course on Julia programming language for whole department.
  About 30 people passed the course.
- Mentored one newcomer, helped and guided junior colleagues.

Researcher · Science · Joint Institute for High Temperatures of RAS
===================================================================

Moscow, Russia ⋅ 2017 – 2024

- Researched impact of retrograde condensation phenomena on two-phase flow in porous medium.
  Developed finite volume and finite element solvers for fluid dynamics of hydrocarbon mixtures.
  Looked for innovative ways of oil extraction.
- Researched fluid phase equilibria of natural hydrocarbons (gas, oil).
  Developed fast and robust isobaric- and `isochoric-isothermal <https://github.com/vvpisarev/CubicEoS.jl>`_ solvers for two-phase equilibria.
  Designed software architecture for the last solver the way it can be applied with any equation of state (e.g. Peng-Robinson or some SAFT equation).

Software engineer · Electronics · SPE Detector, LLC
===================================================

Dubna, Moscow region, Russia ⋅ 2022 – 2024

- Managed software development: collected requirements, approved list of features and user interface.
- Developed desktop software and user interface for remote control (manual, scenario-based) of programmable power supplies.
  Designed software the way it works with different instruction sets and different communication types.
- Developed end-user app for generation print-friendly reports for internal and customer documentation.

Teacher · Higher education · Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology
=======================================================================

Dolgoprudny, Moscow region, Russia ⋅ 2019 – 2023

- Co-authored and taught `course on computational thermodynamics <link_thermodynamics_course_>`_ for four-years students based on my experience in JIHT RAS.
  Materials are available online.
- Taught algorithms and data structures course for first-year students.
  Managed collaboration of five teachers.

Education
---------

PhD degree · Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology
==========================================================================

Department of molecular and chemical physics ⋅ 2019 — 2023

Thesis: `Methods of numerical optimization for predicting phase equilibria in fluids <https://search.rsl.ru/ru/record/01012215755>`_.
The defence was in Joint Institute For High Temperatures of RAS.

Internship · Nuclear Safety Institute of RAS
=============================================================

Department of computational thermodynamics and fluid dynamics · 2017 — 2018

Topic of internship is computational fluid dynamics of multiphase flows.

Master degree · Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology
=============================================================================

Department of molecular and chemical physics ⋅ 2017 — 2019

Thesis is dedicated to computational fluid dynamics of two-phase flows in porous medium.

Bachelor degree · Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology
===============================================================================

Department of molecular and chemical physics ⋅ 2013 — 2017

Thesis is dedicated to simulation of isobaric-isothermal phase equilibria in mixtures of hydrocarbons.

Some projects
-------------

Proportio app
=============

I love to cook and tried new recipes each week.
I had to scale recipes, which is tedious to do by hand.
There were no user friendly apps for this, and that's why I created `Proportio <link_proportio_>`_.

As of 2025Q3, I've got about $120 donations, 40 anonymous reviews and several user interviews.
In 2025Q3, Proportio had about 200 active users.
During work on Proportio I learnt about lean methodology, user interfaces and Vue 3.

Course on computational thermodynamics
======================================
The goal was to teach students (also, they are junior researchers) for numerical methods we need in our scientific department.
My PhD advisor create draft plan, while I created `materials <link_thermodynamics_course_>`_, continiously improved them and taught the course for three years.

I learnt to teach, write clean materials and staying focused.
Also, I welcomed Docker for the first time.
