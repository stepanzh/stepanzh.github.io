## AKIRA PROJECT
This is first serious and completely my work in frontend. This site is assumed to be my cv or smth like that.
I dedicate it to Akira anime/manga. I just played with some effects and experimented. On 29 of November 2017 there is no at least
one feature: disabling of scroll or generating content after clicking on navigation buttons. I faced some problems with asynchronous
js behaviour. But I don't want to use any special libriaries like slick.js for that. Perhaps, I'd find a solution.
